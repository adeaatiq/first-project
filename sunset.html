    <p> Sunset is the <a href="#nowhere">disappereance</a> of the Sun below the horizon due to Earth's rotation. As
        viewed from everywhere on
        Earth, it is a phenomenon that happens daily except in areas close to the poles in their respective winters.
        The equinox Sun sets due west at the moment of both the spring and autumn equinoxes. As viewed from the
        Northern
        Hemisphere, the Sun sets to the northwest (or not at all) in the spring and summer, and to the southwest
        in the autumn and winter; these seasons are reversed for the Southern Hemisphere.</p>

            Sunset colors are typically more brilliant than sunrise colors, because the evening air contains more
            particles
            than
            morning air. Sometimes just before sunrise or after sunset a green flash can be seen.
            Ash from volcanic eruptions, trapped within the troposphere, tends to mute sunset and sunrise colors, while
            volcanic ejecta that is instead lofted into the stratosphere (as thin clouds of tiny sulfuric acid
            droplets),
            can yield beautiful post-sunset colors called afterglows and pre-sunrise glows. A number of eruptions,
            including
            those of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 and Krakatoa in 1883, have produced sufficiently high stratus clouds
            containing
            sulfuric acid to yield remarkable sunset afterglows (and pre-sunrise glows) around the world. The high
            altitude
            clouds serve to reflect strongly reddened sunlight still striking the stratosphere after sunset, down to the
            surface.

        <h3> LOCATION ON THE HORIZON</h3>

            <p> Approximate locations of sunset on the horizon (azimuth) as described above can be found in Refs.The
                figure on the right is calculated using the solar geometry routine as follows:

                For a given latitude and a given date, calculate the declination of the Sun using
                Calculate the sunset time, which is the solar noon time plus the sunset hour angle in degree divided by
                15;
                Use the sunset time as input to the solar geometry routine to get the solar azimuth angle at sunset.
                An interesting feature in the figure on the right is apparent hemispheric symmetry in regions where
                daily
                sunrise and sunset actually occur. This symmetry becomes clear if the hemispheric relation in sunrise
                equation
                is applied to the x- and y-components of the solar vector presented in Ref.[9]
